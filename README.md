# TY Introduction to Coding with Python
This Repo contains my entire course introducing Transition Year Students to Programming through python.

This is based initially on the python course provided by CSinc but has been modified and updated by me for use through trinket.io or Replit as to accompany the taught course in my class. I have created and added extra assignments to help students grow their knowledge in this area as well as adding extra lessons for students that wish to continue their learning.

My aim for this course is to create a foundation that students that progress to Computer Science will be able to build upon. I envisage that this course will be a living course receiving regular changes and amendments, But for the moment is in the initial stages of creation.

I have used ChatGPT by OpenAI along with other LLMs such as Bing and Bard to assist me in the structure and content of the course but modified to suit what I wish to accomplish with the course.

As well as exercises that can be carried out by the students I have included all suggested solutions created by myself. As is true of all coding however there may me more than one correct solution.
