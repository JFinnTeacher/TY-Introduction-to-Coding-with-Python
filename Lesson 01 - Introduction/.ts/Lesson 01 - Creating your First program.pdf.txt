Using the Print Command   Python uses the print function to output characters to the screen. Functions are case sensitive and   must all be in lower case so python will recognise  print  as a command but  Print  will give an error   message. Open your IDE and type in the following Breakdown of the function print() - This is the function that tells python to place characters on the screen. The () is an   important part of this as everything in the brackets will be printed to the screen "Hello World" - This is what will be output. Strings must be enclosed with " " to display   properly. Working with Multiple lines of code   To print multiple lines of code you can simply use multiple print commands Python has a command that will force the text to move to a new line \n. By placing this in the   string where you want the new line to start Working with Tabs   The print command will reproduce whatever is between " " such as in the example below A similar effect can be easily created using the specialist tab command \t placed in a similar way to   the new line command as shown below Summary   In this lesson we covered the following What python is and where it is used Using an IDE to create our code Characters and Strings Functions p r i n t ( " H e l l o   W o r l d " ) p r i n t ( " I ' m   l e a r n i n g   t o    C  o d e " ) p r i n t ( " I ' m   u s i n g   P y t h o n " ) p r i n t ( " I ' m   l e a r n i n g   t o    C  o d e   \ n I ' m   u s i n g   P y t h o n " ) p r i n t ( " *         T h i s   t e x t   h a s   s p a c e s   c o n t a i n e d   i n   i t             * " ) p r i n t ( " * \ t T h i s   t e x t   h a s   s p a c e s   c o n t a i n e d   i n   i t \ t * " )
